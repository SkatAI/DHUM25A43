Here’s a **succinct breakdown** of the **cost and infrastructure involved in training recent large language models**, like **GPT‑5, Opus (Anthropic), and Qwen**, based on current insights:

---

### GPT-5 (OpenAI)

- **Training Cost**: Estimated between **\$1.25 billion and \$2.5 billion**, using **250k–500k NVIDIA H100 GPUs** over \~3 months ([Wikipedia][1], [Klu][2]).
- **Alternate Estimates**: HSBC projects costs up to **\$1.7–2.5 billion** ([LinkedIn][3]).
- **Earlier Run**: Another analysis suggests a single 6-month run could cost around **\$500 million in compute alone** ([The Wall Street Journal][4]).
- **Energy Consumption**: Training may require **50,000 H100 GPUs**, with enormous electricity demand—possibly thousands of MWh—and corresponding environmental impact ([HackerNoon][5]).

---

### Opus (Anthropic)

- Unfortunately, direct public details on **Opus’s** training cost or infrastructure are scarce.
- Note: Anthropic’s **Opus** is part of their model lineup (e.g., Claude 3 includes Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) and remains proprietary—no open cost or system data has been released ([Wikipedia][1]).

---

### Qwen (Alibaba)

- **Infrastructure & Licensing**: Models like **Qwen 2.5-VL-32B-Instruct** and **Qwen 3 family** utilize advanced hardware (e.g., GPUs for MoE setups) and are released under **Apache 2.0** ([arXiv][6]).
- **Scale**: Training involved huge datasets (up to **18 trillion tokens** for Qwen 2.5)—the scale suggests significant compute demand ([arXiv][6]).
- **Operational Pricing**: For hosted inference, **Qwen-VL-Max** costs around **\$0.00041 per 1,000 input tokens** ([Wikipedia][7]).
- However, explicit training cost data (hardware, duration, etc.) hasn’t been publicly disclosed.

---

### General Trend: Cost Escalation & Infrastructure Demands

- A study finds that infrastructure and training costs for frontier models have been growing approximately **2.4× per year since 2016** ([arXiv][8]).
- These rising costs are driven primarily by:
  - **Hardware** (AI chips, networking)
  - **Labor** (R\&D staff)
  - **Energy consumption**
    These often represent tens to hundreds of millions of dollars per training run ([TIME][9], [Epoch AI][10]).

### Quick Reference Table

| Model / Company      | Estimated Training Cost                           | Infrastructure Highlights                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **GPT-5 (OpenAI)**   | \$1.25 B – \$2.5 B (or \~\$500 M per 6-month run) | 250k–500k H100 GPUs; massive energy & cooling needs |
| **Opus (Anthropic)** | Not publicly available                            | Proprietary; likely similar scale, but undisclosed  |
| **Qwen (Alibaba)**   | Not publicly disclosed                            | MoE architecture; trillions of tokens; Apache 2.0   |
| **Frontier Models**  | Rising 2.4× annually; billion-dollar range soon   | Major compute, infrastructure, and labor expenses   |
