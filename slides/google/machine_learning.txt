Discovering Machine Learning Algorithms
What is Machine Learning?

Systems that learn patterns from data

Key types:

Supervised Learning (prediction)

Unsupervised Learning (exploration)


SHS Example: Predicting voter turnout; Clustering interview transcripts

Supervised Learning – Regression

Algorithm: Linear Regression

Goal: Predict continuous outcome (e.g., income, turnout rate)

SHS Example: Predicting voter turnout based on age, income

Visual: Plot with regression line on synthetic data

Code snippet in Colab

Supervised Learning – Classification (Part 1)

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Goal: Predict category (yes/no, left/right)

SHS Example: Classify political orientation based on survey data

Visual: 2D classification plot

Code snippet in Colab

Supervised Learning – Classification (Part 2)

Algorithms:

Decision Tree (interpretable, rule-based)

Random Forest (robust, ensemble)

SHS Examples:

Predict protest participation (Decision Tree)

Classify opinion on policy (Random Forest)

Visual: Decision boundaries from models

Supervised Learning – Classification (Part 3)

Algorithms:

k-Nearest Neighbors (local similarity)

Support Vector Machine (SVM, decision boundaries)

SHS Example: Classify support for climate action based on sociodemographics

Visual: 2D classification plots

Train/Test Split – Evaluate the model

Training set: used to teach the model.

Test set: used to evaluate how well the model performs on new, unseen data.
Precision: How many predicted positives were correct
Recall: How many actual positives were correctly found
Accuracy: How many predictions (positive & negative) were correct


Unsupervised Learning – Clustering

Unsupervised Learning – Clustering

Algorithm: k-Means Clustering, Hierarchical clustering

Goal: Find hidden groups in data

SHS Example: Group citizens by shared attitudes on democracy

Visual: Synthetic clustering example

Unsupervised Learning – Dimensionality Reduction

Algorithm: PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

Goal: Reduce complexity, find main dimensions

SHS Example: Reduce political ideology survey to key axes

Visual: 2D projection of high-dimensional data

Other Paradigms

Neural Networks




How can large language models (LLMs) be used effectively in practice?

Vibe Coding

Prompting for Vibe Coding
I have a DataFrame df containing a textual column called "text". I want to use an LLM (I’m using LLaMA models via Groq,) to extract the following elements from each text:
Names of participants (e.g., people or organizations involved)
Topics (general subjects or themes)
Arguments (positions, reasoning, or opinions expressed)
The extracted data should be stored in new columns within the same DataFrame. Please generate python code with comments
