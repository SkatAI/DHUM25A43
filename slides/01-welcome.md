# The Course

---

# What is this course about?

**Data Science for Social Sciences using AI**: Applying _data science_ techniques to social science research.

**Data Search and Collection**: Searching, gathering, and transforming datasets.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploring textual content, categories, temporal evolution, extracting names, topics, and their relationships.


Very data centric!

---

# What do you do with all that data?

**Data enrichment**: Enriching datasets with additional information.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Results**: Combining qualitative insights with quantitative analysis and visual representation of findings. You analyze the data.

**Data visualization**: Presenting outcomes through interactive documents and websites. what's the story, what's the narrative?

---

# What is this course about?

<div class="boom">
This is not : "investigating with data science"
<br />
It is : **investigating with AI**
</div>

**AI**: LLMS, Agents, prompting, vibe coding, ... going meta
**hands on**: projects, practice, learning by doing
**Enlightment**: Web, APIs, NLP, ML, DL, coding in python

---

# Why AI?

<div class="note">
LLM : large language models, aka agents, AIAgents,
</div>


- **Super Powerful LLMs**: Revolutionizing data analysis, interpretation, and automation.
- **Impact on Data Science**: Enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of workflows.
- **Code Generation with LLM**: Quickly develop data analysis pipelines
- **Use of LLMs as an Autonomous Data Analysis Tool**: extract patterns, trends, and insights from raw data. Analysis of large datasets or documents
- **Accessible Methods**: Simplifying complex data processes with user-friendly tools.

# AI vs Humans (March 2023)

[**How Smart is ChatGPT?**](https://www.maximusai.com/blog/how-smart-is-chatgpt)

<div class="note">
GPT 4.0 has made impressive strides over GPT 3.5 but continues to struggle in certain subjects.

According to OpenAI, the essays that GPT-4 produced for these tests were graded by "qualified third-party contractors".

GPT attempted 10 programming contests 100 times each, but was unable to consistently find solutions to the more complex problems.
