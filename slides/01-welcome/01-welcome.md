# A Thorough Recap of 2024

**Things we learned about LLMs in 2024**

by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/).

<div class="note">
A lot has happened in the world of Large Language Models over the course of 2024. Here's a review of things we figured out about the field in the past twelve months, plus my attempt at identifying key themes and pivotal moments.
</div>

# Over 120 new models released in 2024!

**Released Models 2024**
- **Open Source Models: 55**
- **API Only Models: 63**

# Chatbot Arena: LLMs vs LLMs

**Where LLMs compete** [https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard)

<div class="note">
Total #models: 194. Total #votes: 2,557,144. Last updated: 2025-01-20.

Creative Writing: #models: 190 (98%) #votes: 385,176 (15%)

# 2024

**70 models from 18 organizations are now [performing](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard) better than GPT4**

- GPT-4 level models run on a laptop (not mine tho)
- Multimodal vision is common, audio and video are starting to emerge
- Prices have dropped => less energy
- EU AI act

# AI vs Humans (March 2023)

[**How Smart is ChatGPT?**](https://www.maximusai.com/blog/how-smart-is-chatgpt)

<div class="note">
GPT 4.0 has made impressive strides over GPT 3.5 but continues to struggle in certain subjects.

According to OpenAI, the essays that GPT-4 produced for these tests were graded by "qualified third-party contractors".

GPT attempted 10 programming contests 100 times each, but was unable to consistently find solutions to the more complex problems.

# Emergence

# Emergence

**Complex systems exhibit properties or behaviors that are not reducible to their individual components.**

<div class="columns">

<div>

**Strong Emergence**: raises the possibility of truly intelligent machines!
- The observed abilities are **genuinely novel**, irreducible to the individual components or algorithms of the LLM.
- the **wetness of water** isn't found in individual water molecules.

**Weak Emergence**: sophisticated but fundamentally different from human intelligence
- The observed abilities can still be **explained** by the underlying mechanisms,
- But their appearance is unexpected and simply difficult to predict.
- ~ modeling **traffic patterns** using the behavior of individual cars.
