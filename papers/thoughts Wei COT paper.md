from Wei COT paper, in appendix, : emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol mapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc).

It's like watching a new form of intelligence rising from model to model

the compounding of small nuggets of intelligent abilities gives rise to more powerful abilities
COT is the result of such compounding


from level 0 to level 1: see above
and then combining level 1 abilities to get to level 2
what will the level 2, 3, 4 abilities be ?

new abilities not available to humans ?

the success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated
phenomena that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol
mapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc)
