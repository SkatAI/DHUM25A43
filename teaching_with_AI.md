## Teaching

from Mollick AI teaching strategies

- assess prior knowledge
- step by step approach: from simple to complex
- organizational cues: we are here, this is next
- concrete details, multiple,  to each explanation

goal: students can explain a concept to other students

Low-stakes tests:

- Tests do not simply measure knowledge; they are a learning event.
- active retrieval practice, prompting students to recall information from memory,
- aka diagnostic quizzes

distributed practice vs massed practice

- Distributed practice, or having students practice material several
times over days and months, is critical to developing robust and flexible knowledge
- massed practice â€“ one topic is covered, then another, and then another, in a linear fashion, without reference to previous topics and without a direct connection between topics


1. numerous examples;
2. varied explanations and analogies;
3. low-stakes tests (help students retrieve information)
4. assessment of knowledge gaps;
5. distributed practice.

recap questions

- What was the most important idea or concept covered in class today?
- Why do you think this idea is important?
- What is the most difficult class concept so far?
- What did you struggle to understand? What concept or problem would you like to see explored in more detail? (Angelo & Cross, 2012).
