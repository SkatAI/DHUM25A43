# Claude

This is a course for 2nd year students at Sciences Po in English titled : Investigating with AI
They have no technical background. Some may have worked with R or have math background.

This is a very hands on course.
Evaluation is project based. During the last class students will present their project.

Throughout the course student will be encouraged to use AIs. Code questions, strategy questions, data questions, etc. The more the better.

## Goal

- basic education in Internet
- Machine learning,
- NLP
- Trends and tools in AI : platforms, strategies, etc
- linear regression as the main analysis tool
- basic coding skills. vibe coding. main principles (DRY, KISS, YAGNI)

but also
- understand the current societal narrative on AI.



at the end of the course students should be able to
- build a dataset
- explore and analyse the dataset
- build a streamlit app to visualise the results for a report.
- see through the hype, the doom and the fog
- are proficient with a number of AI related tools.

I want the students to be blown away by what we can do with AIs

## Student Project

- choose their own subject
- build a relevant dataset : API, scraping, already available data
- define questions

Then
- propose technical analyses to answer the questions
- data exploration
- data enrichement
- define the story and narrative

finally
- present their findings, online web or in a report

## Tools

- google docs, google drive
- github: for course content
- discord
- google colab: for demos and student practice
- AI chats: chatGPT, Claude, Qwen, Mistral, etc.
- we may also use github.dev for the streamlit part

## Session

Each session should have

- wake up intro (I'll do that)
- news review: what's new in AI, Machine learning, NLP and Internet in the past week. students will be asked to read newsletters and blogs such The Neuron , The rundown AI, Ethan Mollick blog, etc . Students will be asked to share their reading with the class. short. what got your eye, and why youb think this is imporatnt. + any questions related to stuffs you've seen.
- lecture of the day. slides (Me)
- demo of the day. where I demo the concepts just seen. Google colab. Shared with the class. live demo version and solution all done version
- short intermission with a video related to popular culture on AIs (Hal, ...)
- hands on task, where they have to basically reproduce what i've demoed on their own dataset or speciific ones

It's a 8 to 10 AM session. needs to be fun, engaging, interactive, lots of good energy.

## Core values

- don't waste your time
- learn something
- questions are precious.
- AIs know everything. But humans still have the questions.

## Slides

We will use jekyll based slides.
